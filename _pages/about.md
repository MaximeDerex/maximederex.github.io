I am a CNRS Research Scientist in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/groups/department-social-and-behavioral-sciences?tabs=0) and the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/).

Previously, I worked as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow in the [Human Behaviour, Culture and Cognition group](https://ecologyconservation.exeter.ac.uk/research/themes/human-behaviour/) at the University of Exeter. From 2014-2017, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Human Evolution & Social Change](https://shesc.asu.edu/) and the [Institute of Human Origins](https://iho.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University.

My research investigates the mechanisms underlying cumulative cultural evolution. Through experiments and other methods, I explore questions such as: What cognitive abilities enable humans to produce increasingly complex technologies? What kinds of social interaction patterns promote collective intelligence? And to what extent do pre-existing solutions constrain exploration and creativity?
